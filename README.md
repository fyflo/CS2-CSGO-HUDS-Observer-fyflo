- An example of how my HUD works [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liKSKBNt224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liKSKBNt224)

## How does it work?

Basically, CS:GO/CS2 is streaming data to local app-server, that transforms data and then load it to local webpage.

## To-do before running

- Node.js needs to be installed
##
#### CSGO
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\ `gamestate_integration_observerspectator.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS:GO location
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\ `observer.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS:GO location
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\ `observer_on_map_cs2.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS:GO location
#### CS2
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\ `game` \csgo\cfg\ `gamestate_integration_observerspectator.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS2 location
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\ `game` \csgo\cfg\ `observer.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS2 location
- SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\ `game` \csgo\cfg\ `observer_on_map_cs2.cfg` needs to be placed in cfg folder in CS2 location
##
- CS:GO/CS2 needs to run on Fullscreen Windowed (I know people may dislike it, but since it's only for observation, soo...)
- After running CS:GO/CS2 and connecting to match (or replaying a demo, you can use this in it too), type to console `exec observer.cfg`/`observer_on_map_cs2`, it makes everything default disappear besides map and killfeed (can use `exec observer_off.cfg`/`exec observer_on_map_cs2` to turn back to normal)
- Ensure everything in the `config.json` file is filled out

## Configuration

```javascript
//config.json
{
    "GameStateIntegrationPort":1337, //This must be the same as in gamestate_integration_observerspectator.cfg,
    "ServerPort":2626, //Some free port on your PC
    "SteamApiKey":"ABCDEFGIJK12345678", //Steam API Key, without it avatars won't work
    "PrintPlayerData": false, // Useful for seeing steamid of players in the game to add to players database
    "DisplayAvatars": true, // Display Obs Avatars
    "DisplayPlayerAvatars": false, // Display custom set player avatars from the players database
    "DisplayTeamFlags": false, // Display team flags under the team rounds score
    "DisplayPlayerFlags": true, // Display players flag on the observed player section
    "DisplayAvatars": false, // true for yes, false for no
    "AvatarDirectory":"./public/files/avatars/", // Local storage for avatars
    "SpecialEvent": "SHOWMATCH", // If create match type is set to NONE, it will use this text - used for something else, just leave alone
    "LeftImage": "/files/league/miceklogo.png", // Left Section Image
    "LeftImage2": "/files/league/supearmiceklogo.png", // Left Section Image
    "LeftImage3": "/files/league/turniej_logo.png", // Left Section Image
    
    "LeftOneImage": "/files/league/turniej_logo_kopia.png", // Left section, one big image for the entire container
    "DisplayOnlyMainImage": false, // Check this to display only one big image instead 3 smaller
    "_onlyComment": " this image ^^^ (LeftOneImage) should be 405px x 85px ",
    
    "DisplayScoreboard": true, // Scoreboard appears at the end of the round (once in 4 rounds)
    "DisplayRadar": true, // Show radar border (if RUN_RADAR didnt work)
    
    "LeftPrimary": "Left Primary Text", // left Section Top Words
    "LeftSecondary": "Left Secondary Text", // Left Section Bottom Words
    "RightImage": "/files/img/elements/icon_microphone.png", // Right Section Image
    "RightPrimary": "Right Primary Text", // Right Section Top Words
    "RightSecondary": "Right Secondary Text", // Right Section Bottom Words
}
```

## How to make it run?

- Install NodeJS (nodejs.org)
- Download this repo somewhere
##
- Start RUN_HUD.bat file and RUN_RADAR.bat if you want to include a third-party mini card
##
- Start RUN_HUD.bat file if you want to keep the mini map from the game.
##
- Run Overlay Exe from here: [OVERLAY DOWNLOAD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gHMgI85guGmWOkSV4aqhUl0hUOSioxV1/view?usp=sharing) or just go to your browser [http://localhost:2626](http://localhost:2626)
- Ensure that in the Overlay exe folder, there is a config.json file with the following:
- Radar will be on :36364 port [http://localhost:36364](http://localhost:36364)

```javascript
//config.json
    {
        "port": 2626 // same port as ServerPort as stated in the 'big' config.json file above
    }
```

## How to make it work with OBS?
- In your OBS create a new scene
- In scene, click on plus button and add window capture and choose csgo.exe
- Add browser and in url copy and paste your CS-GO/CS2 link
- Add second browser and paste url for radar (it should look like this)

## Admin Panel

After starting the code go to address showing up in terminal/command prompt. You should see Admin Panel divided in three parts - Teams, Players, Create Match and HUDs. In here you can manage data used in HUDs during match ups.

#### Teams tab

You can here define teams, their name, short names (actually short names are not use anywhere for now), their country flag and logo. Files for teams' logos are being held in `public/storage/` and their filename should start from `logo-`.
![Ex1](https://i.imgur.com/7HPOrB0.png)

#### Players tab

In Players tab you can define player's real name, displayed name, country flag (can also be set to "The same as team"), their team and, to identify players, SteamID64. Files for players' avatars are being held in `public/storage/` and their filename should start from `avatar-`.
![Ex2](https://i.imgur.com/tiDnUPj.png)

#### Create match tab

Here you can set type of match - is this a map of NONE, BO1, BO3 or BO5, score for teams and which team it should load to HUD. In case players are on the wrong side (left/right) there is `SWAP` button to quickly tell the HUD to swap teams' name, logo and flag.
Additionaly, if during the match you decide that there is a type in team's or player's information, you can change it (for example on mobile phone, if you allow Node through firewall and you are on the same local network) and then in this tab click the `Force Refresh HUD`, to make sure all the changes are applied.

![Ex3](https://i.imgur.com/61l8zd7.png)

### HUDS

This tab shows local HUDs. They are not validated whether or not they actually work, but if any of the files is missing, it will notify you in Warnings column.
You can enable/disable each HUD to make it accessible or not. There is also HUD URL information - if you click it, it will redirect you to local webpage, that's serving as a HUD. It is useful if streamer wants to stream HUD separately - for example it can be added in OBS as Browser Source, then you just need to set it to HUD's URL.
It might be useful for bigger streaming workspaces, like for setups with different PC dedicated to replays - one server app will manage every HUD on local network, because all HUDs are available all the time, if they are not disabled.

### LIVE PAGE

In this tab you can easily show/hide scoreboard and radar border while HUD running

![Ex5](https://i.imgur.com/cyg5Ws4.png)

## How to create your own HUD
Go to `public/huds` and copy and paste `default` folder and rename it to your heart's content - that's how your HUD will display in Admin Panel.
`template.pug` - template of your HUD in PUG, required.
`style.css` - css to your template, reccomended.
`index.js` - engine of your HUD. Look at the default one and at the template to get the idea how it works.

In `index.js` the most important part is `updatePage()` function. It is required for any HUD to work, because this function is called when data is coming from CS:GO. 

All of main action that will take place on your screen happens in `updatePage()` function, so when you want to represent some information you will need to write your code within its boundaries.
```javascript
function updatePage(data) {
	//Here happens magic
}
```
`data` argument is being passed to it, and from that we can take actions, such as getting informations about players, map, round phases, etc. Below you will find detailed information about received information :>

### `data`

Methods to obtain different objects:



|Method|Description|Example|Returned objects|
|---|---|---|---|
|`getTeamOne()`|Information about Team 1 defined in Admin Panel|`var teamOne = data.getTeamOne();`|JSON:`{team_name: "SK Gaming", short_name: "sk", country_code: "Brazil", logo: "logo-1527775279488.png", _id: "MT3xr6mb37o8Vbe3"}`|
|`getTeamTwo()`|Information about Team 2 defined in Admin Panel|`var players = data.getTeamTwo();`|As above|
|`loadTeam(id)` id: String |Information about team defined in Admin Panel with given id|`var players = data.loadTeam("MT3xr6mb37o8Vbe3");`|As above|
|`getMatchType()`|Information which matchup type is this|`var matchup = data.getMatchType();`|String: `bo2`, `bo3` lub `bo5`|
|`getMatch()`|Information about match set up in panel|`var match = data.getMatch();`|JSON: `{match: "bo5", team_1: {map_score:1, team:"auto"}, team_2: {map_score:1, team:"MT3xr6mb37o8Vbe3"}}`|
|`getPlayers()`|List of players|`var players = data.getPlayers();`|(Array of Players)|
|`getCT()`|CT's informations|`var ct = data.getCT();`|(Team)|
|`getT()`|T's informations|```var t = data.getT();```|(Team)|
|`getObserved()`|Currently spectated player|```var player = data.getObserved();```|(Player) If you are not spectating anyone, returned Player will have Steam ID 1 and name GOTV|
|`getPlayer(observer_slot)` observer_slot: Int|Player with given observation slot (o-9)|```var first = data.getPlayer(1);```|(Player)|
|`phase()`|Game's current phase|```var phase = data.phase();```|(Phase)|
|`round()`|Round's information|```var round = data.round();```|(Round)|
|`map()`|Map's information|```var map = data.map();```|(Map)|
|`previously()`|If anything changed since last update, it will contain the previous value|```var previously = data.previously();```|(Array) More information about `previously()` you will find on the bottom|


Example:
```javascript
function updatePage(data) {
	var player = data.getObserved(); // Getting spectated players object
    var teamLeft = data.getTeamOne(); // Team 1's informations
    var teamRight = data.getTeamTwo(); // Team 2's informations
    
    var round = data.round();
    
    // Setting teams' names
    $("#team_one_name").html(teamLeft.team_name); 
    $("#team_two_score").html(teamRight.team_name);
    // Those might be null if none specified, then use getT() and getCT() 
    
    //Setting teams' flag
    if(teamLeft.country_code){
        $("#team_1 #team_flag").css("background-image", "url('/files/img/flags/"+teamLeft.country_code + ".png')");
    }
    if(teamRight.country_code){
        $("#team_2 #team_flag").css("background-image", "url('/files/img/flags/"+teamRight.country_code + ".png')";
    }
    
    var playerlist = data.getPlayers(); // Array of player objects
    if(playerlist){
        for(var steamid in playerlist){
        	/* Actions here will be taken for each player */
            let player = playerlist[steamid];
            
            let displayed_name = player.name;
            let real_name = player.real_name; // If real name isn't set, it will show player.name
        }
    }
